This story is drowning in "telling" and desperately needs a rescue from the clutches of exposition.  The author is so busy explaining what's happening that they forget to *show* us the story. 

**Here's a breakdown of the problems, and how to fix them:**

**1.  The Narrative Voice is a Talking Head:**

* **Problem:**  The story reads like a history textbook, using a flat, omniscient narrator that simply *tells* us everything about Elias, his motivations, and the world around him.
* **Solution:**  Embrace a more immersive narrative voice.  Maybe Elias himself reflects on his life, or perhaps the story is told through the eyes of a worker in his factory, or even a rival trying to bring him down.  Give us a character's perspective, and we'll experience the story, not just be told it.

**2.  No Bite in the Dialogue:**

* **Problem:**  There's almost no dialogue.  The characters are walking, talking exposition machines.  
* **Solution:**  Use dialogue to reveal character, move the plot forward, and create conflict.  Imagine a scene where Elias confronts a worker who's been injured in his factory.  Their conversation could reveal his inner turmoil, the worker's anger, and the complex relationship between them.

**3.  The Plot is a Straight Line:**

* **Problem:**  The story moves in a predictable pattern.  Elias is ambitious, he succeeds, he feels guilty, he tries to make amends. It's formulaic and lacks any surprising turns.
* **Solution:**  Introduce conflict and subplots.  How does Elias's ambition affect his family? Does he have a secret that could destroy him?  Is there a rival who's determined to take him down?  Throw in a few plot twists to keep the reader guessing.

**4.  The World Feels Flat:**

* **Problem:**  The setting of Pittsburgh is described in broad strokes.  We get "coal smoke" and "slums" but no real sense of the city's atmosphere, the people who inhabit it, or the sights and sounds that make it unique.
* **Solution:**  Show us the world through the senses.  Describe the smell of the steel mills, the clanging of the hammers, the desperation on the faces of the workers.  Use vivid language to paint a picture of Pittsburgh, and make it a character in the story.

**5.  The Characters are Cardboard Cutouts:**

* **Problem:**  Elias is a walking stereotype of an industrialist.  He's ambitious, ruthless, and then he becomes remorseful.  He lacks depth and complexity.
* **Solution:**  Give Elias flaws and contradictions.  Perhaps he's driven by a desire to escape his own poverty, or maybe he's trying to prove his father wrong.  Give him a personal life, a wife, children, or a past that shapes his choices.

**Here are some specific examples of how to "show, don't tell":**

* **Instead of:** "He saw the lives lost in factory accidents." 
* **Write:**  "The scream ripped through the air, a sound Elias recognized with a sickening familiarity. It was the sound of steel, tearing flesh, and the scream of a man who had no chance to scream again." 

* **Instead of:** "He feared repeating the mistakes of his father."
* **Write:**  "He watched his father, his face etched with lines of hardship, his hands scarred by a life spent at the forge. Elias saw the ghost of his own future, a life of toil and endless struggle, and a fear, deep and primal, took root in his soul." 

**Remember:**  This story has the potential to be compelling.  It has a strong premise, but the author needs to dig deeper, explore the characters, and let the story unfold organically.  Embrace the power of showing, of letting the reader experience the world and the characters for themselves.  Use dialogue to create conflict, and don't be afraid to take risks.  If the author is willing to push themselves, they can create a story that is truly captivating.
